## ParkPal: a Webapp to find information on National Parks

-Motivation

This project is a basic application applying the National Park Service API, Leaflet JS, and Materialize. The user can query the search box for a National Park by State and it will display a map of the park and basic information useful to the user.

-Why this was built

This project was built to exhibit using multiple data APIs and one CSS Library in conjunction to create a basic Web Appliation and learn how to complete it collaboratively as a team.

-What it solved

ParkPal addresses the challenge of finding information about the National Parks in a user friendly manner. It integrates the National Park Service API so users can quickly search for parks by state and recieve a map along with details about each park. It simplifies the process of planning outdoor activities and provides users with practical information like basic details and weather. It enhances the user experience with the integration of Leaflet JS for an interactive map and Materialize for a modern and responsive design.

-What we learned

When developing ParkPal we learned how to

- Use third party APIs to fetch real-time data from the National Park Service.
- Use Leaflet JS to add dynamic mapping features, letting users interact with map data.
- Apply Materialize, a responsive front-end framework to create a modern mobile-optimized UI.
- Collaborate effectively within a team to achieve a cohesive product, with each member contributing unique skills and perspectives.
- Overcome technical challenges, such as handling a git repository collaboratively and handling asynchronous data calls in a client-side application.
- Ensure an application is accessible and user-friendly and focuses on intuitive navigation and clear presentation of information.
